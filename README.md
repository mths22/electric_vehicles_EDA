# 🔋 Electric Vehicle Market Analysis (EDA)

This project explores electric vehicle adoption trends using a real-world dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into how electric cars are distributed across regions, brands, and time — and understand what factors might be driving their growth.

---

## 📄 Executive Summary

### 🚗 Problem Statement

Electric vehicle (EV) adoption has grown rapidly in recent years, but that growth varies by region, vehicle type, and manufacturer. Understanding these patterns helps identify opportunities for expansion, marketing strategy, and infrastructure investment.

This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to answer key questions such as:

- Where are electric vehicles most concentrated?
- Which brands are leading the market?
- How has EV adoption evolved over time?
- Are buyers leaning toward full electric or hybrid options?

## 📊 Visual Insights

### 🔌 BEV vs. PHEV Distribution

![BEV vs PHEV Distribution](screenshots/electric_type_distribution.png)

This bar chart compares the number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The distribution is clearly skewed toward BEVs, reflecting increased consumer preference for fully electric options in recent years.
